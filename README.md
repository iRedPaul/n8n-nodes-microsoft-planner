# n8n-nodes-microsoft-planner

This is an n8n community node that allows you to interact with Microsoft Planner in your n8n workflows.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

[Microsoft Planner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/task-management-software) is a task management tool that helps teams organize, assign, and collaborate on tasks.

## Installation

## Usage

### Using the Node as an AI Tool

The node is marked as `usableAsTool`, so n8n can generate a corresponding AI tool variant for Agent workflows. This lets an AI agent create, read, update, and organize Microsoft Planner data through the same community node.

For the best results in Agent workflows:

- Prefer entering Planner, Bucket, Group, and Task IDs directly when configuring the tool
- In tool mode, prefer the text and JSON fields instead of list selectors, date pickers, and dropdowns
- Use `dueDateTimeText` and `startDateTimeText` for agent-supplied dates
- Use `priorityText` with `urgent`, `important`, `medium`, or `low`
- Use `scopeText`, `filterByText`, and `contentTypeText` for agent-friendly mode switches
- For complex task updates, prefer the JSON fields for attachments, checklist items, and plan category labels
- Use a clear tool description in n8n so the model knows whether it should create, search, update, or delete Planner data

### Tool Mode Field Guide

When the node runs as an n8n AI tool, the UI exposes simplified fields so the AI can fill more values through placeholders.

- `attachmentsJson`: JSON array of attachment objects
- `checklistJson`: JSON array of checklist item objects
- `categoryDescriptionsJson`: JSON object mapping Planner category keys to labels
- `dueDateTimeText`: Free-text due date/time, ideally ISO 8601
- `startDateTimeText`: Free-text start date/time, ideally ISO 8601
- `priorityText`: `urgent`, `important`, `medium`, or `low`
- `scopeText`: `my` or `group`
- `filterByText`: `plan` or `bucket`
- `contentTypeText`: `text` or `html`

Examples:

```json
{
  "attachmentsJson": "[{\"url\":\"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team/spec.docx\",\"alias\":\"Implementation spec\",\"type\":\"Word\"}]",
  "checklistJson": "[{\"title\":\"Review draft\",\"isChecked\":false},{\"title\":\"Share update\",\"isChecked\":true}]",
  "categoryDescriptionsJson": "{\"category1\":\"Backlog\",\"category2\":\"Blocked\",\"category3\":\"Ready\"}"
}
```

```json
{
  "dueDateTimeText": "2026-03-08T14:30:00Z",
  "startDateTimeText": "2026-03-01 09:00",
  "priorityText": "important",
  "scopeText": "group",
  "filterByText": "bucket",
  "contentTypeText": "text"
}
```

### Creating a Task

To create a task:

1. Enter the **Plan ID** (you can find this in Microsoft Planner URL or via Graph Explorer)
2. Select a **Bucket** from the dropdown (loads automatically based on the Plan ID)
3. Enter the **Title** of the task

Optional fields:

- **Description**: Detailed task description
- **Priority**: Select from dropdown
  - Urgent (highest priority)
  - Important
  - Medium (default)
  - Low
- **Priority Text (tool mode)**: `urgent`, `important`, `medium`, or `low`
- **Assigned To**: Comma-separated list of user emails (e.g., `user1@domain.com, user2@domain.com`)
- **Due Date Time**: When the task should be completed
- **Start Date Time**: When work on the task should begin
- **Date Text Fields (tool mode)**: Use `dueDateTimeText` and `startDateTimeText` with ISO-like values such as `2026-03-08T14:30:00Z`
- **Percent Complete**: Task completion percentage (0-100)
- **Checklist**: Add multiple checklist items with titles and checked status
- **Attachments**: Add external references/attachments with URLs, aliases, and types (Word, Excel, etc.)
- **Description**: Detailed task description (stored in task details)

### Getting Tasks

**Get a single task:**

- Enter the **Task ID** manually (no dropdown available for single task lookups)

**Get many tasks:**

- Choose filter type: **Plan** or **Bucket**
- Enter the **Plan ID**
- If filtering by Bucket: Select bucket from dropdown or enter Bucket ID manually
- In tool mode, use `filterByText` with `plan` or `bucket`
- Set a limit or return all tasks

### Updating a Task

To update a task:

1. Enter the **Task ID** manually
2. Update any of these fields:

- Title
- Description
- Priority (via dropdown or `priorityText` in tool mode)
- Assigned users (via email list)
- **Due Date Time** or `dueDateTimeText` in tool mode
- **Start Date Time** or `startDateTimeText` in tool mode
- **Percent Complete**
- **Move to different bucket**
- **Checklist**: Add new items or update existing ones (supports "Replace All" mode)
- **Attachments**: Add new references (supports "Replace All" mode)
- **Description**: Update the task description

### Getting Files from a Task

To get all files attached to a task:

1. Enter the **Task ID** manually
2. The operation returns:
   - **taskId**: The task ID
   - **fileCount**: Number of attached files
   - **files**: Array of file objects with:
     - **url**: Decoded SharePoint URL (ready to use)
     - **alias**: Display name of the file
     - **type**: File type (e.g., PowerPoint, Word, Excel, PDF, Other)
     - **previewPriority**: Priority for preview display
     - **lastModifiedDateTime**: When the file reference was last modified
     - **lastModifiedBy**: Who last modified the reference

### Creating a Comment

To create a comment on a task:

1. Select **Comment** as the resource
2. Choose **Create** operation
3. Enter the **Task ID** manually
4. Enter the **Content** of the comment
5. Optionally select **Content Type**:
   - **Text** (default): Plain text that will be wrapped in HTML
   - **HTML**: Custom HTML content
   - In tool mode, use `contentTypeText` with `text` or `html`

The comment will be created as a conversation thread in the Microsoft 365 Group associated with the plan. If the task doesn't have a conversation thread yet, one will be created automatically.

### Getting Comments from a Task

To get all comments from a task:

1. Select **Comment** as the resource
2. Choose **Get Many** operation
3. Enter the **Task ID** manually
4. The operation returns:
   - **taskId**: The task ID
   - **commentCount**: Number of comments
   - **comments**: Array of comment objects with:
     - **id**: Comment ID
     - **content**: Comment body (HTML)
     - **from**: Author information
     - **createdDateTime**: When the comment was created
     - **lastModifiedDateTime**: When the comment was last modified

**Note**: Once a comment is posted in Planner, it cannot be deleted or edited via the Microsoft Graph API or the Planner UI (for Basic plans). This is a limitation of the Microsoft 365 Groups conversation system that Planner uses.

### Working with Plans

The **Plan** resource allows you to manage Microsoft Planner plans:

- **Create**: Requires an **Owner Group** (selected from dropdown or entered as ID) and a **Title**.
- **Get Many**:
  - **My Plans**: Lists plans the authenticated user is a member of.
  - **Group Plans**: Requires a **Group ID** to list plans owned by that specific group.
  - In tool mode, use `scopeText` with `my` or `group`.
- **Get**: Retrieve full plan metadata. Enable **Include Details** to get category descriptions (labels) and other metadata.
- **Update**:
  - Change the plan **Title**.
  - **Category Descriptions**: Update the labels for the 25 color-coded categories (Category 1-25).
  - In tool mode, prefer `categoryDescriptionsJson`.
  - **Shared With**: Update plan members using a JSON mapping of user IDs.
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the plan.

### Working with Buckets

The **Bucket** resource manages the columns or categories within a plan:

- **Create**: Requires a **Plan ID** and a **Name**.
  - **Upsert**: When enabled, the node will check if a bucket with the same name already exists in the plan and return that instead of creating a duplicate.
- **Get Many**: Lists all buckets within a specific **Plan ID**.
- **Update**: Change the bucket **Name** and its **Order Hint** (controlling the position in the UI).
- **Delete**: Removes the bucket from the plan.

### How to Find Plan IDs

You can find your Plan ID in several ways:

1. **From Planner URL**: Open Microsoft Planner in browser, the URL contains the Plan ID:

   ```
   https://tasks.office.com/.../ planId=YOUR_PLAN_ID_HERE /...
   ```

2. **Via Microsoft Graph Explorer**:
   - Go to https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer
   - Sign in
   - Run: `GET /me/planner/plans`
   - Copy the `id` field from the plan you want

### Resource Locator (From List / By ID)

When creating tasks or filtering by bucket:

- **From List**: Select from dropdown (automatically loads based on Plan ID)
- **By ID**: Manually enter the ID if you already know it

For Get/Update/Delete operations, you need to manually enter the Task ID.
